# Passport Photo AI - User Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you create compliant U.S. passport and visa photos in just a few simple steps.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Upload Your Photo
1. Click the **"Click to Upload a Photo"** button
2. Select a photo from your device (JPEG, PNG, or HEIC format)
3. Your original photo will appear on the left side

**Tips for best results:**
- Use a photo with good lighting
- Face the camera directly
- Ensure your face is clearly visible
- Use a plain background if possible
- Photo should be at least 600x600 pixels

### Step 2: Review the Analysis
Once uploaded, the app automatically analyzes your photo and shows:

**Compliance Checklist** (middle column):
- ✅ **Green checkmark** - Requirement met
- ❌ **Red X** - Requirement not met
- ⚪ **Gray dot** - Not yet evaluated

The 8 compliance checks:
1. **High-resolution** - Photo is at least 600x600 pixels
2. **Head centered** - Your face is horizontally centered
3. **Correct head size** - Head height is 50-69% of image height
4. **Plain background** - Background is plain white/off-white
5. **Neutral expression** - No smiling or frowning
6. **Eyes open** - Both eyes are open and visible
7. **No shadows** - Face is well-lit without shadows
8. **No obstructions** - No glasses, hats, or headphones

### Step 3: Use Background Removal (Optional)
If your background isn't plain white:
1. The **"Remove Background"** toggle is enabled by default
2. Toggle it off if you want to keep your original background
3. The photo will automatically reprocess when you change the toggle

**Note:** If the background check fails but background removal is enabled, you'll see "Will be replaced" instead of a failure indicator.

### Step 4: View Your Processed Photo
The processed photo appears on the right side:
- Automatically cropped to 2x2 inches (600x600 pixels)
- Enhanced for optimal quality (brightness and contrast adjusted)
- Saved at 300 DPI for government submission
- Ready to download

### Step 5: Download Your Photo

**Single Photo Download:**
1. Click **"Download Single Photo"** button
2. File saves as `passport_photo_2x2.jpg`
3. This is your official passport photo ready for submission

**Print Sheet Download** (only available if fully compliant):
1. Choose **4x6** for 2 photos on a 4x6 inch sheet
2. Choose **5x7** for 4 photos on a 5x7 inch sheet
3. Print sheets include cutting guides
4. Perfect for printing at home or at a photo lab

### Step 6: Start Over (Optional)
To process another photo:
1. Click **"Start Over"** button
2. Upload a new photo
3. Repeat the process

## Understanding the Results

### What if Face Detection Fails?

**"No face detected"**
- Make sure your face is clearly visible
- Try a photo with better lighting
- Ensure you're facing the camera directly

**"Multiple faces detected"**
- Only one person should be in the photo
- Crop the photo to show only yourself
- Remove other people from the frame

### What if AI Analysis Finds Issues?

The app will show a list of specific issues to fix:
- **Background issues** - Use background removal or retake with plain white background
- **Expression issues** - Retake with neutral expression (no smiling)
- **Eyeglasses** - Remove glasses and retake photo
- **Shadows** - Improve lighting or move to better-lit area
- **Head coverings** - Remove hats (unless for religious reasons)

### Compliance Status
